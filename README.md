GolfTeamApp was created as a potential solution for a local golf team in need of a way to better organize and manage their events/players.

It follows MVC and designates users into unique roles based on their responsibility to the team (ex: athlete or coach).

Different roles have different levels of visibility and permissions within the app.

At the lowest level/role, users can view when their next practice or tournament will be and who their partner is. They have the ability to RSVP and 
input their scores from the events. Coaches/Admins are able to create and manage events, assign partners and athletes, and view additional information
about each user (contact info, skill level, etc.).
